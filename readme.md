# rpi setup

rpi setup is a collection of guides about doing various things that might involve a RaspberryPi

The guides assume that you've run `git clone https://github.com/andrewjmonks/rpi-setup.git` in the home directory of your pi.

## structure

One single github repo includes the website, its source files, and the source files for the pi. 

The website is generated from individual markdown files in the `/docs` folder, into `_site`. If you're in your pi terminal, read the docs with `less ~/rpi-setup/docs/wifi-at-saic.md`

Pi source files and scripts are in `/src`.
