# Hi!

I'm [Andrew](http://monks.co).

I use this website as a sort of lab notebook: if I figure out how to do something I might need to do again, I (sometimes) document the process here.

I primarily work in two domains: web development, and embedded hardware with RaspberryPis. My documentation tends to be about etiher of those things, or about the syntax for useful tasks in command line utilities I use less-than-regularly.
