# view images inside a terminal

I often use my pi over ssh (or really [mosh](mosh-tmux.html)). Sometimes I want to view an image on the pi, but I don't want to mess with an x server or anything fancy. 

I use caca-utils for this; it converts images into ascii-art and renders them directly into the terminal

## install

	sudo apt-get install caca-utils

## usage

	cacaview image.png
