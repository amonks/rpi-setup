# 	sound on raspberrypi

The volume usually seems to start at zero; you'll need to turn it up within the alsa mixer, which you can open up with:

	alsamixer

navigate with arrow keys.

I'm using a [cheap usb audio interface](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSS6CS/) for a crappy mic input. it works.
